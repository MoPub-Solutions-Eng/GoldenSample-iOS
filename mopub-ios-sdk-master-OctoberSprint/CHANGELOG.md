### <a name="disableViewability"></a>Disabling Viewability Measurement
There are a few options for opting out of viewability measurement: 
##### Opting Out in a Manual Integration
Before dragging the MoPubSDK folder into your Xcode project, simply delete the “Moat” folder to opt out of Moat or the “Avid” folder to opt out of IAS in MoPubSDK/Viewability/. If you would like to opt out of both, delete both folders.
##### Opting Out in a CocoaPods Integration
Including `pod 'mopub-ios-sdk'` in your Podfile will include both IAS and Moat SDKs, as well as the MoPub SDK. In order to opt out:
- `pod 'mopub-ios-sdk/Avid'` will include the IAS SDK, but not the Moat SDK, as well as the MoPub SDK.
- `pod 'mopub-ios-sdk/Moat'` will include the Moat SDK, but not the IAS SDK, as well as the MoPub SDK.
- `pod 'mopub-ios-sdk/Core'` will only include the MoPub SDK, with viewability measurement totally disabled.

Make sure to run `pod update` once your Podfile is set up to your preferences.
##### Software Disable
If you would like to opt out of viewability measurement but do not want to modify the MoPub SDK, a function is provided for your convenience. As soon as possible after calling `[[MoPub sharedInstance] start]`, call `[[MoPub sharedInstance] disableViewability:(vendors)]`. In place of “(vendors)”, `MPViewabilityOptionIAS` will disable IAS but leave Moat enabled, `MPViewabilityOptionMoat` will disable Moat but leave IAS enabled, and `MPViewabilityOptionAll` will disable all viewability measurement.

### Disclosure
MoPub v4.16 SDK integrates technology from our partners Integral Ad Science, Inc. (“IAS”) and Moat, Inc. (“Moat”) in order to support viewability measurement and other proprietary reporting that [IAS](https://integralads.com/capabilities/viewability/) and [Moat](https://moat.com/analytics) provide to their advertiser and publisher clients. You have the option to remove or disable this technology by following the opt-out instructions [above](#disableViewability).

  - Updated native mediation framework to support Facebook Audience Network SDK 3.18.2

### IMPORTANT UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS

As of version 3.0.0, the MoPub SDK uses Automatic Reference Counting. If you're upgrading from an earlier version (2.4.0 or earlier) that uses Manual Reference Counting, in order to minimize integration errors with the manual removal of the `-fno-objc-arc` compiler flag, our recommendation is to completely remove the existing MoPub SDK from your project and then integrate the latest version. Alternatively, you can manually remove the `-fno-objc-arc` compiler flag from all MoPub SDK files. If your project uses Manual Reference Counting, you must add the `-fobjc-arc` compiler flag to all MoPub SDK files.

## Version 2.4 (August 28th, 2014)

  - **Simplified native ads integration**: integration instructions and documentation are available on the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-ios-sdk/wiki/Native-Ads-Integration)

  - **Native ads content filtering**: Added the ability to specify which native ad elements you want to receive from the MoPub Marketplace to optimize bandwidth use and download only required assets, via `MPNativeAdRequestTargeting.desiredAssets`. This feature only works for the six standard Marketplace assets, found in `MPNativeAdConstants.h`. Any additional elements added in direct sold ads will always be sent down in the extras.
  - Added star rating information to the `MPNativeAd` object, via `MPNativeAd.starRating`. This method returns an `NSNumber` (double value) corresponding to an app's rating on a 5-star scale.
